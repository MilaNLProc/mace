Dear user,

Please find attached your file. It contains two sheets:
one with the positive indicators for each label and one
with the negative indicators (note that if you have only
two labels, the positive indicators of one label are the
negative ones of the other, and vice versa). If you do not
see any indicators, you might have provided too few texts
per label.
